### Best Practices

1. **Image Loading**
   - Use supported formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
   - Consider image size for performance

2. **Light Adjustment**
   - Use values between -1 and 1
   - -1 for darkest, 1 for brightest
   - 0 for original brightness

3. **Resizing**
   - Enter positive integer values
   - Consider aspect ratio
   - Large resizing may affect quality
